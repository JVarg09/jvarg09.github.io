        On 7/21/2023 Jayden, Scott, Luca, and Aarion were playing a roblox game called Elected Admin. The admin was TinPot and he was a very nice guy giving us admin commands. We made nuclear bombs and airplanes using btools. We also dug underground tunnels to build bases. After a few hours, we decided to build a little town underneath the map. We made stairways that lead to the bottom of the map and started building houses. I made a living room because cool. People saw what we were doing and tried to blow everything up but I added lots of support so that it wouldn't fall by one little explosion. TinPot jailed the griefers lol!!!! TinPot also made his own little area at the bottom. After that we all got together and took screenshots. Defintely one of the coolest guys I have ever seen.
